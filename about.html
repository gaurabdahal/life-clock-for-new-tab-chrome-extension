    <h1 id="desc">A Modified New Tab For Your Chrome</h1>
	<div class="clear"></div>

  <p id="desc"> Every moment is fleeting away in the unknown infinity of our memory, We say everyday it's 6am, and every morrow comes with the same hours that illusions us like a dew's mist. But there is something morphing every moment, maybe we're oblivion of. Instead of being drown into the same hour again and again which we unknowingly accept, what if we could realize the preciousness of the current hour. 6am only comes once in our life, all the other time it's regarded as a universal time and thatâ€™s not the actual hour of our life. Since we're adding up every hour as if it was the same hour which would come again tomorrow, what if we could differentiate this hour which would never return again? 
  <br/><br/>
	<span>This chrome extension exactly shows you in which hour of your life you're currently living thus encouraging you to live in the current hour which was never there in past and nor would  come again in future. Lots of us say "from tomorrow, I would do this or that" and repeat the same phrase again and again, without realizing that we're walking upon new hours of our life.</span></p>
